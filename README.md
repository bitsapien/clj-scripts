# Useless scripts in Clojure

A product of my attempts to learn Clojure 

_Uses [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) to run the scripts, which is a faster way to run clojure without having to invoke the JVM_

### Global Commit History

This script looks at your zsh_history file and shows a list of commit messages you made since the start of time

_Usage_
```sh 
bb ./global-commit-history.clj
```
