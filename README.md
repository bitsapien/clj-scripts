# Useless scripts in Clojure

A product of my attempts to learn Clojure 

_I've used [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) to run the scripts, which is a faster way to run clojure without having to invoke the JVM_

* Global Commit History
  _This script looks at your zsh_history file and shows a list of commit messages you made since the start of time_
  ```sh 
  $ # Usage
  $ bb ./global-commit-history.clj
  ```
